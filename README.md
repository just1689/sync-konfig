# sync-konfig
The goal of this project is to provide a way to host a <a href="https://github.com/lalamove/konfig">Konfig</a> server and also to a client for use with that server. I would like to build on-top of Kong as it is stable, fast and highly extensible.
 
For now connecting will happen over websocket. The remote address to connect to will also be loaded using Konfig.
